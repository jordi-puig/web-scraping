NCT04315831;Safety and Effectiveness of Transdermal Buprenorphine in Cancer Pain;Safety and Effectiveness of Transdermal Buprenorphine in Cancer Pain: an Observational Study (SOOTHE);"Buprenorphine transdermal patch is newly available in Taiwan in June 2017, the trade name is Transtec, and the available dosages are 35 μg/h and 52.5 μg/h. Taiwan is the first Asia country which launched Transtec for cancer pain treatment. Although the efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine has been demonstrated in some randomized, placebo-controlled studies and also conducted a large scale post-marketing surveillance study in Germany, therefore the local scientific data is required for Asia experience. Due to above rationale, this observational study will be initiated in Taiwan, to build up the first real-world scientific data in Asia.

NCT03752268;Development of an Intervention to Enhance Cancer Pain Management;Development of an Intervention to Enhance Cancer Pain Management;This research study is being done to understand how patients with chronic cancer pain take their long-acting opioid medications, and to develop an intervention to enhance cancer pain management.;"Long-acting opioids are a common treatment for cancer pain. The purpose of this study is to develop a program for patients who are taking a prescribed long-acting opioid for their cancer pain. Participants will be enrolled in this study at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. This 14-week study involves completing a set of questionnaires at three different times during the study period. . During the study period, participants will use electronic pill caps to monitor their pain medication taking. They also will attend a series of three visits with one of the nurse practitioners on their care cancer team. The visits will focus on learning and practicing skills for managing cancer pain. The information that the investigators collect will help identify whether the sessions are feasible and useful to patients during the course of treatment for cancer pain.
This trial will consist of two parts:
Part 1: This is a single-group prospective observational study. Investigators will use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine rates, predictors and outcomes of adherence to LA opioids over a period of approximately eight weeks. This information will be used to inform Part 2 intervention development and testing.
Part 2: Investigators will test the behavioral intervention in a non-randomized open pilot, over a period of approximately six weeks. Intervention process data, psychosocial and medical data, and post-intervention feedback will be collected to assess feasibility and acceptability. In an iterative process, ongoing data from exit interviews and therapist experience will be used to modify the intervention protocol.";April 15, 2014;November 30, 2020   (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure);Other Cancer;"Behavioral: Enhancing Cancer Pain Management

NCT03721211;Imaging With [11C]Martinostat in Breast Cancer;Imaging With [11C]Martinostat in Breast Cancer;"This research study is studying a PET imaging tracer as a possible means of imaging breast cancer.
The imaging agent involved in this study is:
-[11C]Martinostat (called C-eleven-Martinostat)";"This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study imaging agent in patients who have breast cancer.
The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved [11C]Martinostat as an investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.
In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called [11C]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.
The purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.
In this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called [11C]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.
[11C]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous studies of [11C]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems). While this is not the first time [11C]Martinostat has been used in humans, it is the first study in which the investigators are using this tracer to study breast cancer.";February 1, 2020;February 28, 2020   (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure);Breast Cancer;"Drug: [11C]Martinostat

Concurrent malignancy of any type
Recent breast surgery (within the past 12 months) on the ipsilateral breast as the current breast tumor

Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the radioactivity of [11C]Martinostat and the resulting risks of teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of [11C]Martinostat, and because lactation may potentially affect the uptake of [11C]Martinostat on PET, breastfeeding women are excluded from the study.

NCT03863457;[18F] F-GLN by PET/CT in Breast Cancer;Pilot Study Evaluating the Uptake of [18F] F-GLN by PET/CT in Breast Cancer;"Patients with known or suspected primary or metastatic breast cancer with one lesion that is 1.5 cm in diameter or greater may be eligible for this study. Patients may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age. Up to 30 evaluable subjects will participate in a single imaging cohort. Patients will be stratified by breast cancer subtype with prioritization to recruit at least 10 estrogen-receptor-expressing (ER+) and 10 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).
This is an observational study; [18F]F-GLN PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions. While patients and referring physicians will not be blinded to the [18F]F-GLN PET/CT results, treatment decisions are made by the treating physicians based upon clinical criteria.
[18F]F-GLN PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of [18F]F-GLN. Metabolism data will be collected. Pilot data will be collected to evaluate image quality and collect preliminary information on the uptake of [18F]F-GLN in breast cancer. Uptake measures will be compared to tumor markers of glutamine metabolism, when tissue is available. The safety of [18F]F-GLN will also be evaluated in all subjects.";Up to 30 patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic PET scanning followed by up to 2 static skull-base to mid-thigh scans post injection of [18F] (2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]F-GLN). A baseline FDG-PET/CT will also be performed, either as a routine clinical staging/re-staging scan or as a research scan. If performed as a research scan, the scan may include an optional dynamic imaging session. Some subjects, who undergo systemic therapy as part of their clinical treatment, may also undergo an optional second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT to collect pilot data on the changes in [18F]F-GLN uptake in response to therapy. Subjects who undergo a second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT may have a second FDG-PET/CT, again either as a standard-of-care restaging study or as an optional research scan.
