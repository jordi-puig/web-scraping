NCT04359303;Indirect Endovenous Systemic Ozone for New Coronavirus Disease (COVID19) in Non-intubated Patients;Randomized Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Systemic Indirect Endovenous Ozone Therapy (SIEVOT) as Adjuvant Treatment in COVID19 Non-intubated Patients;Systemic medical ozone has proved to help in several viral diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic inflammation process. The investigators are sure that its application to COVID-19 patients, as an adjuvant therapy, will improve the health status of these individuals.;"Due to the extreme world situation caused by COVID19 pandemic, the investigators consider unethical not to try any treatment option with a justified rationale.
The investigators have explained that medical ozone therapy has a clear scientific basement thanks to all preclinical and clinical investigation already published. It can be classified as chemical stressor that produces a modulation in the redox balance and immunity. Moreover, it is easy and safe to administer with insignificant side effects.
The efficacy in viral diseases has been proved in publications together the modulation of interleukin 6 and other proinflammatory cytokines that could potentially help in COVID19 patients. The improve of exchange of gases and microcirculation will surely contribute to enhance this patients' health status.
As explained above, the investigators propose to carry out a randomized control trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of systemic ozone (indirect endovenous) in these patients.";Interventional;Phase 3;"Allocation: Randomized

This puts healthcare workers at a greater risk of acquiring the disease. COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) and many people can be infected with it asymptomatically and undetectably.
Serology is an antibody test that provides additional information to polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) testing as it is the only way to reliably establish the fraction of the population that was infected . Seroconversion is the development of antibodies in the blood which can confirm suspected cases after the fact and reveal who was infected but asymptomatic and never realized it. Antibodies are specific proteins created as the body's response to the infection and this test is essential for detecting infected individuals with few or no symptoms at all.";Not Provided;Observational;;"Observational Model: Cohort

NCT04377685;Prediction of Clinical Course in COVID19 Patients;Prediction of Clinical Course in COVID19 Patients Using Unsupervised Classification Approaches of Clinical, Biological and the Multiparametric Signature of the Chest CT Scan Performed at Admission;"In the context of the COVID19 pandemic and containment, chest CT is currently frequently performed on admission, looking for suggestive signs and basic abnormalities of COVID19 compatible viral pneumonitis pending confirmation of identification of viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction(PCR), with a reported sensitivity of 56-88% in the first few days, slightly higher than PCR (60%) (1). Nevertheless, currently established radiological abnormalities are not specific for COVID19 and the specificity of the chest CT is ~25% when PCR is used as a reference (1). Deconfinement and its consequences will complicate the triage of COVID patients and the role of the scanner, with the expected impact of a decrease in the prevalence of infection in the emergency department and an increase in the number of ""all-round"" patients, including patients with non-COVID viral infiltrates or pneumopathies.
In addition, there are currently no imaging criteria to complement the clinical and biological data that can predict the progression of lung disease from the initial data.";In image processing, computational medical imaging has demonstrated its ability to predict a therapeutic response or a particular evolution after extracting relevant anatomical, functional or even non-visually perceptible information from the volume of images, making it possible to construct a powerful radiomic signature or to use robust anatomical/functional measurements to provide estimates of ventilation or vascular state. By combining these data extracted from the scanner with the standard clinical-biological data produced at admission during triage, our ambition is to build a predictive model using unsupervised classification approaches capable of helping predict clinical evolution with the aim of optimizing the management of the resource.;Observational;;"Observational Model: Cohort

Hypothesis: LIO-C will improve distress (as measured by K10) in adults at 1 week post-intervention compared to a neutral writing control during the COVID19 pandemic.";"The world is currently experiencing unprecedented challenges caused by the global coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic. Many countries are enforcing measures to restrict movement of people to reduce the spread of the outbreak, including lock-downs, social distancing and self-isolation. These methods, although necessary to slow the spread of disease, will have negative effects on psychological well-being of large populations. Shortage of health care professionals and measures to restrict interpersonal contact means facilitated psychological interventions will not be feasible for many, at least during the height of the pandemic. There is therefore a need for self-directed psychological interventions that can be practically and quickly implemented online.
Emotional disclosure-based therapies, such as expressive writing (EW), hold potential as low-cost, easy to implement means of support, with minimal requirement for facilitation. In its original format, EW involved writing daily for 15-20 minutes for 3-4 days about a traumatic event. Since its development, it has been adapted in many ways, including writing about positive events and writing about stress from a compassionate stance. There is evidence that such interventions can provide significant psychological and physical benefits in healthy populations and reduce the effects of natural disasters on health and well-being. However, to our knowledge this form of psychological intervention has not been tested during a rapidly evolving crisis or pandemic.
The aim of this study is to test whether an online self-compassion and EW based intervention (LIO-C) can reduce the negative effects of the COVID19 pandemic on health and well-being. The intervention is based on an existing intervention, LIO, that we previously developed for use in advanced disease populations, in collaboration with clinical and health psychologists, and patient and public representatives. For this study, we have adapted the intervention for people living through the current COVID19 pandemic by altering the writing prompts, and translating the intervention to an online hub. As this is an unfacilitated intervention, the instructions involve writing from a compassionate stance to minimise any potential short term negative effects associated with writing about difficult experiences.";Interventional;Not Applicable;"Allocation: Randomized

Daily CoV-2 PCR testing with high analytical sensitivity (e.g., 2 copies per 8 µl sample) may detect infected residents and visitors before clinical symptoms are apparent. Earlier detection may lead to earlier implementation of the UK standard of care protocol for Infection prevention and control measures, thereby preventing the asymptomatic infected individuals from introducing and/or transmitting CoV-2 within the care home. This should reduce the transmission by:
Preventing the introduction of the virus into care homes from external visitors e.g., GPs (Inward transmission) Preventing the spread of the virus within care homes and preventing cluster development (internal transmission) Preventing the outward spread of the virus from within care homes by infection of external visitors (Outward transmission)";Interventional;Not Applicable;"Allocation: Randomized

NCT04346446;Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Severely Sick COVID-19 Patients;Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Severely Sick COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial;Currently, no effective treatments are available for the COVID-19 pandemic, which is related to more than 70,000 deaths all over the world. Scientists and Researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against COVID-19 which may be beneficial to severely sick COVID019 infected patients. We have planned a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this therapy in COVID-19 infected sick patients. We will collect up to 500 ml Convalescent Plasma from the COVID-19 infected recovered patient after 14 days of clinical and radiological recovery with two consecutive COVID-19 negative tests by PCR. We will further test the sample from the collected plasma for COVID-19 specific antibodies and their titer. This plasma will be frozen and sent to the treating center (MAMC). 200-600 ml of convalescent plasma will be transfused to patients who fit the eligibility criteria and are randomized to the convalescent plasma group. This will be done in severely sick patients. Data will be collected for the benefit and adverse events related to convalescent plasma transfusion.;"For Donors:
Microtiter plates will be coated overnight at 4°C with 4 μg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) proteins (50 μL per well). The plates will be washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% vol/vol Tween-20(PBST) and blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 2% wt/vol nonfat dry milk) for 2 hours at 37 °C. The plates will be then washed with PBST. The serum samples will be diluted to 200-fold into PBS as initial concentration, and serial 3-fold dilutions of serum will be added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. After 3 washes, 100 μL of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (for IgG antibody titer detection)and IgM (for IgM antibody titer detection) antibodies solution will be added to each plate, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. After 5 washes, 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate will be added at room temperature in the dark. After 15 minutes, the reaction will be stopped with a2MH2SO4 solution (sulfuric acid). The absorbance will be measured at 450nm. All samples will be run in triplicate. The IgG titers will be determined by endpoint dilution.
Serum Neutralization Assay Vero cells (104) will be seeded 24 hours before the infection in a 96-well plate. On the day of infection, the cells will be washed twice. Serum samples from patients will be incubated at 56 °C for 30 minutes and then diluted 2-fold in cell culture medium (modified eagle medium). Aliquots (40 μL) of diluted serum samples (from2-fold to 2056-fold) will be added to 50 μL of cell culture medium containing 50 times the tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the virus strain on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours in CO2 5% vol/vol. Virus antibody mix will be added to cells in 96-well plates and plates will be incubated at 37 °C with a microscopic examination for cytopathic effect after 5-day incubation. The highest dilution of serum that showed inhibition activity of SARS-CoV-2 will be recorded as the neutralizing antibody titer. Assays will be performed in triplicate with negative control samples from healthy volunteers.
For recipients:
The serum of each recipient will be obtained and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers will be tested one day prior to the convalescent plasma transfusion. Changes of Receptor Binding Domain-Specific IgG titre and neutralizing antibody titers before and after convalescent plasma transfusion in patients will be obtained on day 0, day 1, day 3 and day 7. if possible.

This phenomenon, called immune memory, helps our bodies avoid reinfection by a bug persons have had before and influences the potency of life-saving treatments and vaccines. Also, the new coronavirus causes cardiac and pulmonary inflammation. So, our study planned to measure the cardiopulmonary and immunological changes in treated COVID-19 patients. Specific objectives: Measurement the duration of existence of COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibody in patient's plasma, detection of cardiac changes, pulmonary radiological and functional changes after COVID-19 infection. This could help detection of functional impairment in COVID-19 survivors which may have economic and social impact. Also, investigator will assess possible protective immune response following infection which may affect vaccination schedule. Methods: One hundred RT- PCR positive COVID-19 patients will be enrolled. HRCT chest, lateral flow immunoassay, spirometry, DLCO and Echo will be done on after 3, 6 and 12 months of discharge.;"• Background and significance:
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. Radiological, lung function changes were reported in different studies of pulmonary viral infection.
After a patient has recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), CT shows transient interlobular septal thickening and reticulation over a course of several weeks to months. The reticulation appears after the 2nd week and peaks around the 4th week. One-third of patients with persistent respiratory symptoms will have imaging findings of fibrosis, including interlobular and intralobular reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and, rarely, honeycombing. Areas of air trapping, caused by damage to ciliated respiratory epithelium, have been reported in 92% of patients who have recovered from pneumonia and are less likely to resolve completely. Likewise, in patients with MERS, although the majority fully recover, 33% show evidence of lung fibrosis on follow-up imaging. These patients were commonly older, had prolonged ICU admission, and had greater lung involvement in the acute phase of the disease.
CT was performed 1 year after MERS-CoV infection in 65 (89%) patients. Radiological sequelae were revealed in 25% (4/16), 63% (19/30), and 95% (18/19) of patients in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The median radiological sequelae score was 0, 1, and 3 in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia groups, respectively, and the radiological sequelae scores were significantly correlated with the severity of pneumonia (P < 0.001). The finding that more severe MERS pneumonia resulted in more impaired lung function strongly suggests that pulmonary sequelae can remain at least 1 year after MERS-CoV pneumonia, which is also supported by the correlation of radiological sequela correlated with the severity of MERS pneumonia.
A previous study showed that 24% of SARS survivors have impaired DLCO and 5% reduced lung volume at 12 months.
A follow-up study of 55 patients with SARS at 24 months revealed that 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV1, FVC, TLC and DL(CO) < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months. However, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey scores were lower than the normal population throughout the study.
Pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome patients 3 months after hospital discharge, but the impairment was mild in almost all cases. Many patients had reduced exercise capacity that cannot be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function.
The deleterious SARS-CoV-2 infection myocardial effects could also be perpetuated by the prompt and severe downregulation of myocardial and pulmonary ACE2 pathways, thereby mediating myocardial inflammation, lung edema, and acute respiratory failure. ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2-related signalling pathways might even have a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and 2 T-helper cells strong interferon-mediated immunopathological events and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia caused by COVID-19, resulting in damage to myocardial cells.
Infection due to viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens initiates complex systemic inflammatory responses as part of innate immunity. Activation of host defense systems results in subsequent activation of coagulation and thrombin generation as critical communication components among humoral and cellular amplification pathways, a term called thromboinflammation or immunothrombosis.
Several serological immunoassays have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and antibodies in the serum or plasma. The most widely used biomarkers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in commercial immunoassays are IgM and IgG antibodies produced in suspects from the 2nd week of viral infection. IgM can be detected in the patient samples from 10 to 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while IgG can be detected from 20 days onwards. The IgM response occurs earlier than that of IgG, but it then decreases and disappears. On the other hand, IgG can persist after infection for a long time and may have a protective role.
A study reported that ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with an RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 RT-PCR positive individuals tested ≥10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively.
• Timeliness, innovative nature and relevance of the project
AS COVID -19 is an emerging pandemic since late 2019, follow up studies of its sequelae are still lacking. The aim is to track any consequences regarding radiological findings, functional impairment of respiratory system and immunological response to COVID -19. This may have an economic and social burden if lung functions are deteriorating post infection. Also, development of an effective vaccination is an issue of great interest all over the world. Existence and duration of persistence of protective antibodies may help prediction of vaccination frequency and better understanding of the nature of the virus.
• Research design and methodologies:
One hundred RT- PCR positive COVID-19 patients will be enrolled.
The following data will be collected:
Medical history: age, sex, occupation, comorbidities, previous treatment, …
Clinical classification of COVID-19 infection:
1- Mild: clinical symptoms without pneumonia 2- Moderate: clinical symptoms with pneumonia 3- Severe: who meet any of the following: respiratory rate 30 breath\minute, oxygen saturation less than 93% at rest and patient with more than 50%lesion progression within 24 to 48h in the lung
Radiological data:
Pulmonary CT pattern of COVID-19 using Philips Ingenuity core 128 the Netherlands:
COVID-19 pneumonia, Type L:
Only ground-glass densities are present on CT scan, primarily located subpleural and along the lung fissures. Consequently, lung weight is only moderately increased.
COVID-19 pneumonia, Type H:
The increased amount of non-aerated tissue Follow up CT at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals
Echocardiography using Sonoscape A5 portable echocardigraph:
3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement
• Pulmonary function test: Spirometry: measurement of lung volumes and capacities (forced expiratory volume in first second FEV1, forced vital capacity FVC, FEV1\FVC and FEF25\75) Diffusion capacity of the lung to carbon monoxide (DLCO) at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement
• Immunological data: Detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibody in patient's plasma During infection and at 3, 6 and 12 months intervals after clinical improvement by BIOCREDIT COVID-19 IgG+ IgM Duo (One Step SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Antibody Rapid Test) RapiGEN.INC.
BIOCREDIT COVID-19 IgG+ IgM Duo is a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of IgG and IgM specific to SARS-COV-2 virus in human serum, plasma and whole blood. Antihuman IgG and IgM conjugated with colloidal gold particles will react specifically with the SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in patient's serum, plasma and whole blood. The colloidal gold conjugated anti-human IgG & IgM and SARS-COV-2 specific IgG & IgM forms antibody-antibody-gold particle complex then it moves to pre-coated SARS-COV-2 NP and Spike protein recombinant antigens on the membrane. The reaction forms antigen-antibody-antibody-gold particle complex then they show as color band at T- line area. The control line (C) is used for procedural control and should always appear if the test is performed correctly.

As the main regulator of cAMP metabolism, posphodiesterase-4 plays a key role in proinflammatory and immune cells. Pentoxifylline plays its anti-inflammatory role by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6.

(Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID19);"The investigators propose to select all COVID 19 patients attended in any health center (with in hospital beds), who have been discharged or have died at the time of the evaluation.
The main objective of the present study is to carefully characterize the clinical profile of patients infected with COVID-19 in order to develop a simple prognostic clinical score allowing, in selected cases, rapid logistic decision making (discharge with follow-up, referral to provisional/field hospitals or admission to more complex hospital centers).
As secondary objectives, the analysis of the risk-adjusted influence of treatments and previous comorbidities of patients infected with the disease will be performed.";"INTRODUCTION. The disease caused by the new respiratory virus (coronavirus) designated as SARS-CoV-2 has recently been classified as a pandemic by the WHO.
With an increasing number of confirmed cases in most countries worldwide, it is responsible for a significant morbidity and mortality and has motivated the implementation of measures at national and international levels with a great impact on the way of life of people throughout the whole planet.
In addition, this condition currently threatens many countries with the collapse of health systems, producing serious logistical problems due to extensive affectation of the population, which can worsen the prognosis of those primarily affected by COVID 19 and other patients with different pathologies and who may have difficulties to get healthcare.
Limited clinical information is available and generally limited to the Asian population, since the first cases were identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China).
PURPOSE. The main objective of the present study is to carefully characterize the clinical profile of patients infected with COVID-19 in order to develop a simple prognostic clinical score allowing, in selected cases, rapid logistic decision making (discharge with follow-up, referral to provisional/field hospitals or admission to more complex hospital centers).
As secondary objectives, the analysis of the risk-adjusted influence of treatments (ie. ACEIs, ARBs) and previous comorbidities of patients infected with the disease will be performed.
DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Cross-sectional and ambispective registry, a real life ""all comers"" type, with voluntary participation, without funding or conflicts of interest. It is a study initiated by researcher that will have advanced statistical support from the IMAS foundation (Institute for the Improvement of Health Care, Madrid, Spain), that will serve as statistical core.
International level.
PARTICIPANTS PROTOCOL. The study has been approved by Hospital Clinico San Carlos Ethic´s Committee (20/241-E) and the institutional board of each participating center. It has received an AEMPS classification (EPA-0D).
The researchers aimto select all the patients attended in any health center (with in hospital beds), who have been discharged or have died at the time of the evaluation.
All will be considered eligible with a positive COVID 19 test (any type) or if their attending physicians consider them highly likely to have presented the infection.
Given the anonymous characteristics of the registry and the health alarm situation generated by the virus, in principle, it is not considered necessary to provide written informed consent.
- Inclusion criteria Patients discharged (deceased or alive) from any hospital center with a confirmed diagnosis or a COVID-19 high suspicion.
There are no exclusion criteria, except for the patient's explicit refusal to participate.
DATA BASE. An anonymized database is presented in electronic format, to be filled in at each participating center (www.HopeProjectMD.com).
In theory, all information could be obtained from electronic records (medical history).
If deemed necessary, the investigator may call patients in order to establish their vital status (strongly warranted), as well as the results of the RNA test (or antibody) , if they were pending during their stay.
SAMPLE SIZE. It would not be possible to estimate for the sample size based on literature reports. Thus, HOPE will aim to get the maximum numbers of patients possible.

The investigators are interested in the benefits of a self-management booklet focused on the current circumstances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on people's physical and mental wellbeing.
Who can participate? The investigators are looking for participants aged 18 and over who live in the UK and can read and write in English, without any current serious mental health problems (e.g. bipolar disorder, PTSD, active thoughts of self-harm, or severe anxiety/depression), and who feel that their physical and/or mental wellbeing have been affected since the COVID-19 pandemic.
What does the study involve? Eligible participants will complete questionnaires at baseline following which they will be randomly allocated to either receive the self-management booklet right away (via email) or after 4 months (waiting-list, in the meantime participants will be provided a link to educational materials). Participants will not be able to choose whether they will receive the self-management booklet right away or be in the waiting-list as a computer system (Qualtrics randomiser) will allocate them to one of the two groups at random. Participants in both conditions will be asked to complete online questionnaires at multiple time points, 2-months and 4-months after allocation. Participants in the waiting-list condition will also be asked to complete the same set of questionnaires at 6- and 8-months after allocation to assess how beneficial they found the self-management booklet.
Participants will also be invited to take part in an audio-recorded interview after T2 to tell us more about how they found the self-management booklet or the educational materials. The investigators will select 30 participants (15 from each condition) for the interview out of those who opt-in to capture a wide range of experiences and backgrounds.
What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Risks to participants are small. Participants may find reflecting on the impact of COVID-19 on their lives distressing. However, these effects are anticipated to be short lived, as participants will learn psychological techniques during the intervention that can help them manage better in the current circumstances and improve their wellbeing.
Where is the study run from? The lead site is King's College London. The study is run online via Qualtrics.
When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? May 2020 to May 2021
Who is the main contact? Dr Federica Picariello federica.picariello@kcl.ac.uk";In the UK, over 4 in 5 Britons are worried about the effect COVID-19 is having on their life, with over half reporting that their wellbeing has been affected. Providing support for individuals to build optimal structures to maintain their physical and mental wellbeing is key to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic on day-to-day life and in the longer term. The investigators would like to conduct a randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of a theory-based self-management booklet to improve physical and mental wellbeing versus education alone. The trial will include a nested qualitative study to explore in a subgroup of participants their experiences of the self-management booklet or education alone. The primary objective is to examine the efficacy of the self-management booklet at improving wellbeing as compared to the waiting-list control arm 2-months post-randomisation. The investigators also want to explore the treatment effects of the self-management booklet on secondary outcomes (health status, day-to-day activities, resilience, intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness, social support, sleep quality, napping, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and COVID-19-related behaviours, symptom complaints). Tertiary objectives include exploring changes in self-reported primary and secondary outcomes over time in a non-randomised analysis combining data from both arms and qualitatively exploring participants' perceptions of the acceptability and usefulness of the self-management booklet. These objectives will be addressed by a two-armed parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a nested qualitative study. The study will be conducted through Qualitrics (including recruitment, randomisation, and data collection). Participants in both arms will be followed-up at 2 and 4 months post-randomisation. Additionally, participants in the control arm will receive the self-management booklet after the 4-months follow-up assessment and will be followed-up at 6 and 8 months post-randomisation.;Interventional;Not Applicable;"Allocation: Randomized

A risk stratification based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters seems necessary in order to better identify those patients who may need hospital and/or ICU admission.
One of the most alarming clinical parameters in general is the presence comorbidities. The underlying diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients with adverse outcomes compared with non-severe patients. Obesity is also a risk factor for COVID-19 severity with increased need to mechanical ventilation.
Chronic diseases share several features with infectious disorders, such as the proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of the innate immune response which may be linked etiologically to its pathogenesis.

NCT04462627;Reduction of COVID 19 Transmission to Health Care Professionals;Reduction of COVID 19 Transmission to Health Care Professionals;"When the COVID-19 virus infects a person, it enters the lung epithelial cells of its host and uses its genetic material to replicate.
The pulmonary epithelial cells of a part of the population, known as ""secretors"", are capable of expressing the antigens of the ""ABO"" system on their surface. This secretory status can be established by determining the antigens of the Lewis blood group system. When the virus replicates in an ""secreting"" individual, the antigens of the ""ABO"" system of the infected individual will be present on the surface of the viruses formed in his/her lungs.
It was shown in 2003 that the response of a given individual to the transmission of a virus depends on his/her blood group and on the antigens of the ""ABO"" system carried by the virus. A patient of group ""O"" would thus defend himself much better against a virus carrying antigens of blood group ""A"", the natural antibodies ""anti-A"" of the patient reducing the ability of the virus to bind to its specific receptor on pulmonary epithelial cells, to penetrate them to replicate itself. The first data collected in Wuhan (China) seems to confirm this hypothesis. A COVID-19 virus transmission model can therefore be established on the basis of blood groups.
In order to reduce the spread of the virus among nursing staff, it is possible to establish a preferential algorithm for patient management based on the ""ABO"" and ""Lewis"" blood groups of patients and ""ABO"" of nursing staff in health care units, if operational and human conditions allow.";Not Provided;Interventional;Not Applicable;"Allocation: Non-Randomized

NCT04404218;The Açaí Berry COVID-19 Anti-Inflammation Trial;Randomized Clinical Trial of Açaí Palm Berry Extract as an Intervention in Patients Diagnosed With COVID-19;The Açaí trial will be testing if the açaí berry extract, a safe natural product with anti-inflammatory properties, can be used as a treatment option in adult patients with COVID-19 in the community.;"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). The virus origins have been studied and evidence so far suggests it originates in bats, with spread to humans likely mediated by an intermediate mammalian. Bats have a dampened Nod-like receptor family, pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammation. Dampening NLRP3-mediated inflammation has been associated with the asymptotic viral status, therefore it is plausible that the pathogenic inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 might be associated with activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Data show that the natural extract of Açaí Palm Berry (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) is a potent inhibitor of NLRP3. This is a safe, inexpensive, and readily available natural health supplement which could be a rapid response treatment intervention for patients with COVID-19.
Our primary objective is to establish whether açai palm berry extract (Euterpe oleracea), given to community-dwelling adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, compared to placebo, improves outcomes over 30 days on the 7-point ordinal scale described by Cao et al, and which is being used widely in COVID-19 trials with the aim of harmonizing endpoints. This study will be a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicentre clinical trial of Açaí Palm Berry extract in adult patients tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 in the last 7 days and that are currently being treated in the outpatient setting. The intervention group will receive 3 capsules of 520mg (one capsule every eight hours) of Acai Palm Berry extract (Nature's Way, NPN80038874) for 30 days. The non-intervention group will receive placebo pills, on top of standard clinical care. Our main endpoint will be the 7-point ordinal scale.
This project has the benefit of offering a safe and widely used natural extract as a potential treatment strategy to decrease inflammation and improve disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. With no vaccine currently available, the search for effective treatments is a timely approach. The potential impact of such a therapeutic agent, if effective, can be quite vast given that it can be readily used by anyone and, most importantly, is affordable in many countries.";Interventional;Phase 2;"Allocation: Randomized

NCT04461340;Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus in COVID-19 Infection;Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus for Treating COVID-19 Infection;This research is planned to illustrate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus as an adjuvant agent to the standard treatment protocol against COVID-19 infection;"In early December 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in Wuhan (China). A novel enveloped RNA β coronavirus was isolated and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2). The new virus rapidly spread across China and worldwide. On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. As of 1July 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in 10,357,662 individuals globally with deaths reaching 508,055 with a morality of 5.37%. Egypt has 68,311 confirmed cases and 2935 deaths.
The virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets from infected patients. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic forms to severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization and isolation in critical care units with the need of mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Main symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough. Common laboratory findings include lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Platelet count is usually normal or mildly decreased. C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are usually increased while procalcitonin levels are normal and elevation of procalcitonin usually indicates secondary bacterial infection. Ferritin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase elevation is associated with severe disease. Chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity.
Severe COVID-19 conditions are usually due to an aggressive inflammatory response known as ""cytokine storm"" that is characterized by the release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung injury, multiorgan failure, and unfavorable prognosis of severe COVID-19 infection have been attributed mainly to the cytokine storm state.
Many proinflammatory cytokines elevate in COVID-19 patients including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon( IFN)-Ȣ stimulating immune cells to invade sites of infection causing endothelial dysfunction, vascular damage, alveolar damage and ARDS. Cytokine storm has been reported in several viral infections including influenza H5N1 virus, influenza H1N1 virus, and the two coronaviruses highly related to COVID-19; ""SARS-CoV"" and ""MERSCoV"".
Currently, there is no vaccine and/or specific therapeutic drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2. Hence, it remains a major challenge to decide what potential therapeutic regimens to prevent and treat severe COVID-19 infections. Effective vaccines are essential to combat against the extremely contagious SARS-CoV-2. Until we have specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, ""repurposed"" drugs have been used to treat COVID-19 patients. At present, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly repurposing the available therapeutic drugs and based on symptomatic conditions. Considering ARDS, followed by secondary infections, antibiotics, antiviral therapy, systemic corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs (including anti-arthritis drugs) are often used in the treatment regimens. Neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, convalescent plasma, and traditional herbal medicines have also been utilized in the treatment of COVID 19. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these treatment regimens remains to be verified by appropriately designed clinical trials. Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is an immunosuppressant that is used to prevent organ transplant rejection by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. mTOR plays a key role in viral replication. In an in vitro experiment, sirolimus has been shown to affect PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway which inhibited MERS-CoV activity. Studies of patients hospitalized with influenza can further shed light on the antiviral effect of sirolimus. In a randomized clinical trial conducted on 38 patients with confirmed H1N1 pneumonia and on mechanical ventilator support, a group treated with corticosteroids and 2 mg/day of sirolimus for 14 days (N=19) showed significantly better clinical outcomes compared with the group treated with corticosteroids only, including shorter median duration of ventilator used. Delayed oseltamivir plus sirolimus treatment in pH1N1-infected mouse model further suggested a significant association between the sirolimus treatment and improved outcomes. At least one in silico study identified sirolimus as one of the 16 potential candidates for treating COVID-19 patients based on data from other human coronavirus infections using network-based drug repurposing model.";Interventional;Phase 2;"Allocation: Randomized

Elderly infected patients and/or those with co-morbidities may suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumonia (COVID-19 disease). Given the high transmission, this virus has spread in recent months from Wuhan (China) to the whole world, becoming a global emergency pandemic. The lack of curative treatment for this disease justifies the need to carry out clinical trials that provide quality evidence on treatment options. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves an uncontrolled inflammatory response of alveolar cells, a treatment that attenuates the cytokine cascade could be key in rescuing the patient's lung tissue. Mesenchymal cells, due to their immunoregulatory potential and regenerative capacity, can be an effective treatment for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Fortunately, there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19. TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At UAB, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety.
Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.
An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which study patients have just been admitted to the regular hospital (non-Intensive Care Unit; ICU) for the diagnosis of COVID19 is proposed. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily anticoagulation as directed by their primary care team. The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for transfer to an ICU. Contact would be daily and via remote processes. Care for the COVID19 patient would otherwise be standard of care and directed by the primary caretakers of the patient.";Interventional;Phase 2;"Allocation: Randomized

NCT04363008;COVID 19 Biomarkers;COVID-19 Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers for Clinical Management, Prognosis and Evaluation of Interventions;Emergent experimental and anecdotal evidence has indicated that critically ill COVID-19 patients demonstrate two patient sub-types (called phenotypes). In one group the disease progresses slowly and patients have a low potential of developing mild respiratory failure, but in the other group, an exaggerated immune response (hyper-inflammation/cytokine storm) may be linked to the onset of precipitous respiratory failure, termed acute respiratory distress syndrome. This syndrome is responsible for a large portion of COVID-19 associated mortality. Thus, determining links between hyper-inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients is of immediate importance.

JUSTIFICATION
The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.
Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently.
CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.
Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.
Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma

RESEARCH DESIGN
Overview
Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19.
Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.
A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):
IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020).
IL-2: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5±4.3 and 6.7±4.3 pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).
IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis.
Analysis Plan
Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.
A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers.
Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.
Nested matched cohort study:
Examine the differences in the ventilator free days in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using an independent samples two-tailed t-test.
Examine the differences in the cardiorespiratory physiologic outcomes (PaO2/FiO2, mean arterial pressure and heart rate) in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed t-tests.

IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).
IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs.

We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis.
Analysis Plan
Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.
A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers.
Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

JUSTIFICATION
The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.
Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently.
CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.
Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.
Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma

RESEARCH DESIGN
Overview
Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19.
Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.
A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):

The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.
Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma

RESEARCH DESIGN
Overview
Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19.
Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.
A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):
IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020).
IL-2: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5±4.3 and 6.7±4.3 pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).
IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis.
Analysis Plan
Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.
A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers.
Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

Examine the differences in the ventilator free days in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using an independent samples two-tailed t-test.
Examine the differences in the cardiorespiratory physiologic outcomes (PaO2/FiO2, mean arterial pressure and heart rate) in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed t-tests.

JUSTIFICATION
The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.
Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently.
CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.

JUSTIFICATION
The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.
Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently.
CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.
Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.
Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma

RESEARCH DESIGN
Overview
Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19.
Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.
A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):
IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020).
IL-2: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5±4.3 and 6.7±4.3 pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).
IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis.
Analysis Plan
Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.
A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers.
Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.
Nested matched cohort study:
Examine the differences in the ventilator free days in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using an independent samples two-tailed t-test.
Examine the differences in the cardiorespiratory physiologic outcomes (PaO2/FiO2, mean arterial pressure and heart rate) in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed t-tests.

IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison analysis.
Analysis Plan
Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.
A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum biomarkers.
Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

NCT04363008;COVID 19 Biomarkers;COVID-19 Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers for Clinical Management, Prognosis and Evaluation of Interventions;Emergent experimental and anecdotal evidence has indicated that critically ill COVID-19 patients demonstrate two patient sub-types (called phenotypes). In one group the disease progresses slowly and patients have a low potential of developing mild respiratory failure, but in the other group, an exaggerated immune response (hyper-inflammation/cytokine storm) may be linked to the onset of precipitous respiratory failure, termed acute respiratory distress syndrome. This syndrome is responsible for a large portion of COVID-19 associated mortality. Thus, determining links between hyper-inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients is of immediate importance. Blood samples will undergo a number of analyses to help us to understand as much as possible about COVID-19. We will also study any differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients are treated with immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19 patients.;"PURPOSES
Determine the prevalence of a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory ""cytokine storm"" phenotype in patients at Vancouver General Hospital
Determine any potential links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients
Profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own

To determine differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients are treated with immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19 patients.
HYPOTHESES
Primary: Based off of previous reports, approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients will demonstrate a cytokine storm phenotype
Secondary: a)Patients exhibiting cytokine storm will demonstrate a higher incidence of ARDS b)We will identify biomarkers for rapid testing c)Host gene variation will influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection
JUSTIFICATION
The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.
Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS, which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains debated currently.
CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of 31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells. McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections. There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.
Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.
RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class. These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.
Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA, clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as little as 50µl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for both serum and plasma

Better understand 1)the links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients 2)the biomarker profile of COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease 3)the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients
RESEARCH DESIGN
Overview
Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the management of COVID-19.
Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and 21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum separator tubes (SST, Vacutainer®, Becton & Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.
A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for cytokine storm syndrome.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult. However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α data is provided. The below presented power calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):
IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020).
IL-2: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5±4.3 and 6.7±4.3 pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).
IL-10: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5±39.6 and 5.3±4.3 pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).
TNF-α: With the estimated mean±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2±20.8 and 71.7±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-α in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17 patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)
Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.
A log2 fold change >1 and an adjusted p value of <0.05 will be used as the threshold of significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value >20.

NCT04353154;The RAPID COVID TRIAGE Algorithm;Development and Evaluation of Applying a Point-of-Care COVID-19 Test Strategy to Triage Patients Presenting With Acute Coronary Syndromes, Respiratory or Hemodynamic Instability and Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests;This study is being conducted to study the use and application of a point-of-care (POC) Covid-19 test developed by Spartan BioSciences and recently approved for clinical use by Health Canada. Phase I of this study will determine the best route for the swabs (nasal, throat, or both), and to determine if this POC test results are comparable to the standard core-lab test results.;"Currently, testing for COVID-19 is carried out with swabs and blood tests that are sent to hospital laboratories for analysis. With the current technology, the turnaround time for test results may take any where from 8 hours up to several days for confirmation of whether you have COVID-19. This delay in diagnosis may delay care, prevent other testing modalities, consume isolation beds and deplete the valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) needed while providing treatment for patients with COVID-19.
Using a new, Health Canada approved technology, we can conduct the virus genetic testing at the bedside with a nostril and throat swab, with results in under 45 minutes. This new ""point-of-care (POC)"" technology, if proven accurate, may help future patients receive faster and more definitive treatment. At the same time, it might help health care teams to preserve resources and optimize care for patients (example: triage use of intensive care or isolation unit beds, determine need for PPE, get quarantined staff back to front line to help with care if they are non-carriers).";Observational;;"Observational Model: Cohort

This prospective, randomized study will include 20 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and undergoing mechanical ventilation for the treatment of respiratory failure. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with 10 patients (Group A) randomized to undergo core warming, and the other 10 patients (Group B) serving as the control group who will not have the ensoETM device used. Patients randomized to Group A will have core warming initiated in the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being treated after enrollment and provision of informed consent from appropriate surrogate or legally authorized representative.;"Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to core warming with the study device (ensoETM) or to standard of care (standard temperature management and treatment). The device will be used as indicated (for warming). Patient temperature measurement will be collected for both the core warming and standard of care arms during the study period (72 hours).
Core warming will be performed using standard technique per instructions for use for the esophageal heat transfer device. The esophageal heat transfer device will be set to 42°C temperature after initial placement, and maintained at 42°C for the duration of treatment. It is expected that patient temperature will increase from baseline by 1°C to 2°C, but due to ongoing heat loss from the patient, the expected maximum patient temperature is below 39°C. The time course of illness of COVID-19 is such that most patients no longer have fever by the time of mechanical ventilation. If patient temperature increases above this range and reaches 39.8°C, the device will be set to an operating temperature of 40°C, thereby preventing any further increase in patient temperature (ambient heat loss precludes patient from reaching device operating temperature).
Control group patients will be managed as per standard of care currently utilized in the ICU, which will include the use of other methods of temperature management as warranted. This would include warming with a forced air blanket only in hypothermic patients (core temperature < 36°C) or antipyretic therapy for febrile patients, as requested by the treating physician. Episodes of hypothermia are infrequent and transient in this population, and the current standard of care generally utilizes a permissive approach to fever (allowing patients to remain mildly febrile) which will continue in the control group without modification (no intentional elevation of temperature will be provided in the control group).

NCT04419610;RAS and Coagulopathy in COVID19;Investigating the Relationship Between the Renin Angiotensin System and the Coagulopathy Associated With COVID-19;To determine whether the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection is driven by overactivation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS);"The proposed study will be run as a double-blind, randomized controlled experimental medicine study in male and female hospitalised (n=60) aged 18 or over, with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients who are admitted due to confirmed COVID-19 infection will be screened with a routine medical assessment (see Table 1) and enrolled if they meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects will be block randomised based on age to continuous intravenous infusion of placebo or TRV027 for 7 days.
Day 1 procedures can occur on the same day of screening and include a venous blood test prior to commencing an intravenous infusion of either placebo or TRV027 at 12mg/hr. The infusions will continue for 7 days. Venous blood tests will be repeated at days 3, 5 and 8, amounting to approximately 120mLs of blood in total over the 8-day period.
Once the infusion has finished, the subjects will remain in hospital for a further 24 hours for vital signs and adverse event monitoring. If a subject exits the trial before the 7-day infusion finishes, they will be advised to remain in hospital for a 24 hour period for monitoring. Subjects will be followed up on Day 30 either via telephone or via medical records.
. The role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in COVID-19 infection has been widely discussed for two reasons. First, SARS-COV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, invades type II pneumocytes in the lung by binding to an enzyme called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As the virus enters the cell, via one of its receptors, ACE2, it is thought that this is internalised and is hence unable to perform its physiological action of converting Angiotensin II (AngII) to Ang(1-7). Second, it has been noted that severe COVID-19 infection has many features which are strikingly similar to the effects of overactivation of the RAS. Indeed, these features are apparent in preclinical models using AngII infusions and include lung injury, lung inflammation, myocardial microinfarcts, characteristic glomerular thrombosis and coagulopathy. The coagulopathy is particularly noteworthy given an early increase in D-Dimer has very high positive predictor value for death in COVID-19, and D-dimer concentrations are unusually high in COVID-19, over and above what would be expected for an acute phase response or a pneumonia caused by a respiratory virus such as influenza.
AngII and Ang(1-7) affect various aspects of the coagulation system including platelets and endothelial cells, and we therefore hypothesise that overaction of RAS is partly responsible for the coagulopathy present in COVID-19 infection. Because the over activation of the RAS in COVID-19 infection is due to both Angiotensin II excess and Ang(1-7) depletion, standard tools to modulate RAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) cannot be used to test this hypothesis as they address the Angiotensin II excess, but not the Ang(1-7) depletion. TRV027 is a similar peptide to Ang(1-7) but is a much more potent biased agonist at AT1R than Ang(1-7) and would be expected to oppose the effects of AngII accumulation, and functionally correct the Ang(1-7) deficiency. Hence it is an appropriate tool to examine the link between RAS activation and coagulopathy in the context of COVID-19 infection.";Interventional;Early Phase 1;"Allocation: Randomized
